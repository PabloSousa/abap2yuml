ABAP 2 yUML
=========

Welcome to ABAP 2 yUML!

This project aims to solve a technical issue for ABAP developers who like UML as part of a product documentation. These developers would like to use SAP standard tool for generating UML diagrams but it has a few technical dependencies and also is still not available in many customers. We try to help these developers offering another way to generate UML diagrams based on ABAP code and we do this using this great tool called yUML.
